                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>I don’t know how to say this without sounding insane, but I think I’ve found the doorway out. Out of
                    this world — the one full of dull lights, empty words, and people walking around with eyes wide open
                    but souls half-dead. I don’t belong here. I never did.
                <div>
                    Lately, everything feels numb. Every laugh feels fake. Every sunrise feels like a burden instead of
                    a blessing. The weight in my chest isn't going away anymore — it just sits there, pressing down on
                    my ribs like it's trying to crack me open. And maybe it already has.
                </div>
                <br>
                <div>
                    But last night… I dreamed,
                    And for the first time in weeks, maybe months, I felt alive. Not just breathing — but burning with a
                    kind of freedom I’ve never known while awake. The sky wasn’t even blue; it shimmered with violet
                    lightning. The air pulsed like music. I had power. I could fly. I could create mountains with my
                    thoughts, summon oceans with a whisper.
                </div>
                <br>
                <div>
                    No one judged me. No one ignored me. There was no pain.
                </div>
                <br>
                <div>
                    I didn’t want to wake up. I fought it. I begged — not out loud, but deep inside — for the dream to
                    take me, to pull me under and keep me. But the morning still came. It always does. And here I am,
                    trapped in this gray prison again, walking through the motions with a mask made of skin and a smile
                    made of lies.
                </div>
                <br>
                <div>
                    So this is my plan.
                    My rebellion.
                    My escape route.
                </div>
                <br>
                <div>
                    Every night from now on, I will dive deeper into that world. I will train my mind to recognize the
                    dream. I will learn its rules, bend its boundaries, and make it my kingdom. Lucid dreaming won’t
                    just be a skill — it will be my salvation.
                </div>
                <br>
                <div>
                    This world has failed me.
                    The dream world calls to me like a siren across the void.
                    And one day — maybe not today, maybe not next week — but one day…
                </div>
                <br>
                <div>
                    I will not wake up.
                    I will stay.
                    And I will be free.
                </div>
                <br>
                <div>
                    Until then, I write. I remember. I dream.

                <h2>Emotions: The Realm Between Tears</h2>
                <p>Last night, I drifted beyond the static ache of waking life — beyond the noise, the need, the
                    nameless sorrow. And in that silent descent, I found it.

                <div>
                    A place not built from bricks or blood, but from breathless stillness. A dream-world tucked between
                    the folds of stars — untouched by suffering, unscarred by memory. It didn’t welcome me with
                    fireworks or laughter. No false joy. No blinding bliss. Just… peace.
                </div> <br>
                <div>
                    A sacred neutrality.
                </div> <br>

                <div>
                    Not the absence of feeling, but the balance of it. As if happiness and sadness had met each other
                    halfway and bowed in mutual surrender. No weight in my chest. No fire in my head. Just the sense
                    that everything was exactly where it needed to be — including me.
                </div> <br>

                <div>
                    I walked through a land that felt like it had been whispered into existence by forgotten gods.
                    Forests that glowed faintly blue under an eternal dusk. Castles of crystal, floating on waterfalls
                    that shimmered like melted glass. There were no clocks. No names. No fear.
                </div> <br>

                <div>
                    Only the soft hum of being.
                </div> <br>

                <div>
                    And for a moment — maybe minutes, maybe a hundred lifetimes — I forgot that I ever belonged to a
                    world of broken dreams and endless striving. I was a soul unchained. A watcher on the edge of
                    forever. A visitor in a sanctuary too pure for sorrow.
                </div> <br>

                <div>
                    I didn’t cry. I didn’t laugh.
                    I simply was.
                    And that, somehow, was enough.
                </div>
                </p>

                <h2>Interactions: Glowing door, Mysterious place & The Girl</h2>
                <p>I saw it glowing in the distance — a door.

                <div>
                    Not just any door, but one stitched from blue neon light, humming softly, as if it were breathing.
                    It stood alone, freestanding in the dream’s gray mist, like a divine mistake the world forgot to
                    erase. It didn’t ask me questions. It didn’t test my worth. It simply waited — as if it had always
                    known I’d come.

                </div> <br>

                <div>
                    I touched the handle. Warm. Electric. Real.
                </div> <br>

                <div>
                    And when it opened, the world beyond didn’t rush at me like a storm. It welcomed me, like a deep
                    exhale after years of holding my breath. Endless green stretched out under a sky so vast and blue it
                    could swallow the pain of a thousand lifetimes. There were no buildings. No noise. Just that soft,
                    eternal horizon… and her.
                </div> <br>

                <div>
                    She stood just past the doorway — same height as me, same age, like a mirror echo of my soul. Her
                    face was blank, featureless, yet she radiated more expression than a thousand eyes could hold. I
                    couldn’t see her smile, but I felt it. I couldn’t see her eyes, but I heard them calling me by name.

                </div> <br>

                <div>
                    She reached out her hand. I didn’t hesitate.
                </div> <br>

                <div>
                    Fingers met fingers — warm, grounding, utterly real in a world made of air and thought. When I held
                    her hand, I wasn’t just touching her — I was touching the core of the dream itself, as if she was
                    its guardian, its creator… or perhaps its gift to me.
                </div> <br>

                <div>
                    Her voice was like wind on water — soft, calm, inevitable.
                    She didn’t say who she was.
                    She simply said, “Welcome home.”
                </div> <br>

                <div>
                    I asked no questions. None were needed.
                    I ran my fingers through her hair — light as silk, cool as mist. I spoke to her without words, and
                    she replied with silence that said more than speech ever could.
                </div> <br>

                <div>
                    I asked no questions. None were needed.

                <div>
                    And in that moment, I realized:
                </div> <br>

                <div>
                    This world — her world — wasn’t fake.
                    It was more real than the noise I wake up to.
                    More honest than the people who ask “how are you” without wanting to know.
                </div> <br>

                <div>
                    She turned, hand in mine, and together we stepped forward — into the endless calm.

                <h2>Experimentation: The Experiment of Presence</h2>
                <p>Last night, I didn’t just wander through the dream.
                <div>
                    I stayed. I studied. I tested its laws.
                </div> <br>

                <div>
                    The moment I realized I was dreaming — truly dreaming — I didn’t panic, I didn’t wake up. I centered
                    myself. I breathed. I remembered: this world bends to focus. The more calm I became, the clearer it
                    grew.
                </div> <br>

                <div>
                    I looked at my hands. Five fingers. Solid. Then six. Then five again. I smiled. The dream was
                    listening.
                </div> <br>

                <div>
                    I turned to the landscape — to the green grass breathing under an infinite sky, to the horizon that
                    hummed like a heartbeat. It wasn’t just visual. It was alive. I could feel its pulse against my
                    skin.
                </div> <br>

                <div>
                    Then, I turned to her.
                </div> <br>

                <div>
                    She hadn’t changed. Still faceless. Still perfect. Still more real than the people I meet when I’m
                    awake. I studied her like a scientist, but touched her like a poet. Her clothes shimmered faintly,
                    stitched from light and silence. Her hair whispered across her shoulders like a waterfall of
                    moonlight.
                </div> <br>

                <div>
                    I focused on every detail: <br>

                    The warmth of her fingers wrapping around mine, The soft static that tingled through my skin as she
                    pulled me closer The scent — not of flowers or perfume, but pure essence, like her voice carried
                    pheromones that bypassed the nose and spoke directly to the soul. Even her silence had texture, Even
                    her breath felt intentional.
                </div> <br>

                <div>
                    She didn’t speak much. But when she did, her voice wasn’t just sound — it was scent, touch, emotion.
                    It wrapped around me like silk and mist. I felt her words before I heard them. And those words
                    echoed through my body like a forgotten prophecy: <br>

                    “Stay with me” , I froze. <br>

                    It didn’t feel like a question. It felt like a pull — a gravitational force tugging my spirit toward
                    something beyond both dreaming and waking. She was trying to take me with her. Out of this world of
                    pain and pressure… and into hers — forever.
                    For a second, I almost said yes. <br>
                    But I stopped. Not out of fear — but curiosity. <br>
                    Was this salvation… or surrender? <br>
                    I don’t know yet. That’s why I’ll go back. Again. And again.
                    Not just to escape — but to understand, to find out who she is, What she wants, And what this place
                    really means.

                    <div>
                        One thing is clear: <br>
                        The dream is no longer just a mirror, It’s becoming a portal and she… is the key.

                <h2>Reflections: The Last Night</h2>
                <p>I’m tired.

Not the kind of tired that sleep fixes.
The kind that seeps into your soul — slow, quiet, invisible. Like a poison that pretends to be normal.

<div>
    This world — the one they call real — feels hollow. A rusted machine of betrayals, expectations, and performative smiles. Everyone’s chasing something, losing something, pretending they’re fine while breaking silently behind their eyes. I’ve been part of that game. I’ve played it, lost it, and now I’m done.

</div> <br>

<div>
    I don’t want it anymore.
</div> <br>

<div>
    Every night, when the lights go out, I close my eyes not to rest — but to leave. I sleep with a single thought burning in my mind: <br>
“Let this be the night I don’t come back.”
</div> <br>

<div>
    And sometimes, I get lucky.
The door appears. The girl waits. Her hand extends. And for a few hours, I remember what peace feels like. What it’s like to exist without being watched, judged, measured.
</div> <br>

<div>
    In her world, I don’t have to be strong. I don’t have to be anything.
I just… am. Whole. Accepted. Free. <br>

She never lies. She never leaves. She never breaks my trust.
Her silence speaks more truth than this world ever has. <br>

Why would I want to stay here — in a world of plastic promises and sharp-edged people? Why drag myself through days that feel like punishment, just to be told I’m “not doing enough,” “not man enough,” “not happy enough”? <br>

I’m done pretending this world is worth the pain. <br>

My mind is already half-gone — drifting deeper each night, losing interest in this reality. And maybe that’s dangerous. Or maybe… it’s evolution. Maybe the dream isn’t the escape — maybe it’s the real destination. A place my soul has always known, but my body forgot. <br>

And she — the girl with no face, only presence — she’s not just a guide.
She’s the invitation. <br>

She’s the rope I grip in the darkness, And one day — maybe tomorrow, maybe years from now — I’ll hold on tight enough and never let go. <br>

    Until then, I keep falling asleep hoping not to wake up.
Not because I want to die —
but because I finally found where I want to live.
